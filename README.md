Line 29 index.html.   Added an ID for link to search-engine-optimization.  Confirmed all links work on page. 

Line 30-82 index.html.  Proper indentation, separated sections, and named sections to make it easer to read.

Line 33 index.html.  Moved the img from css to html, added alt attribute, and added class to img same as the div it is in.

Used outer div box for .content and .benefits to apply changes instead of duplicating css.

Labeled sections in css to match html, and ordered css.  

Refactored CSS.
